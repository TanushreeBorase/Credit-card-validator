# Credit-card-validator
A credit card validator is a simple mini-project that prompts the user to enter a credit card number as a long integer and displays whether that card is valid or invalid. The last digit of a credit card number is the check digit, which protects against transcription errors such as an error in a single digit or switching two digits.
