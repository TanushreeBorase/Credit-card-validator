# Weather Forecast Prediction
-> The "Place Weather App" is a Java Swing-based desktop application designed to provide users with up-to-date weather information for a specified location. 

-> Users can enter the name of a place, and the application retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This weather data is displayed in a user-friendly graphical interface, making it easy for users to access real-time weather conditions.

-> The application uses Java's HttpURLConnection to establish a connection with the OpenWeatherMap API, and it retrieves and displays the JSON-formatted weather data in a text area. Users can customize the application by replacing the placeholder API key with their own OpenWeatherMap API key. 

-> This Place Weather App serves as a basic example of how to create a desktop application for accessing external data sources and provides a foundation for building more sophisticated weather applications with additional features and improved user experience. 

# OBJECTIVE
		
1.  Real-Time Weather Information: The primary objective of this project is to provide users with access to real-time weather data, ensuring the information is current and accurate. This serves to meet the increasing demand for timely weather updates.
   
2.  Secure Data Retrieval: A key objective is to establish secure and reliable connections with external data sources through the utilization of Java's HTTP capabilities, specifically the HttpURLConnection class. This is vital to ensure the trustworthy retrieval of weather data.

3.  OpenWeatherMap Integration: The project aims to seamlessly integrate with the OpenWeatherMap API, which offers extensive coverage of weather-related information, enhancing the richness and comprehensiveness of the data accessible to users.
   
4.  Customization and Security: Providing users with the option to substitute the provided API key with their own key is a fundamental objective. This not only aligns with best practices but also ensures the security of user credentials, while enabling customization of the application to specific needs.
